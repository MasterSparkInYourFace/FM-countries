# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher solution

This is a solution to the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

I made the vectors myself 'cause the starter files didn't come with any and I'd rather not go to some freemium site to download low effort PNG icons that I have to then write an attribution for. you can use these I suppose
